# OCASC Knowledge base backend

This project was created as a part of Random Hacks of Kindness, October 2018 for the Ottawa Council of School Councils.

Goal: to create a more manageable system of interaction between the Ottawa Carleton District School Board, OCASC, and parents in schools.

Current methods of communication between parents, the board, and the OCASC are difficult to manage and outdated. This project hopes to rectify this issue, thereby increasing organizational transparency and bettering general communication.
